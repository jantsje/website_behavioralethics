abstract: Does everybody lie? A dominant view is that lying is part of everyday social
  interaction. Recent research, however, has claimed, that robust individual differences
  exist, with most people reporting that they do not lie, and only a small minority
  reporting very frequent lying. In this study, we found most people to subjectively
  report little or no lying. Importantly, we found self-reports of frequent lying
  to positively correlate with real-life cheating and psychopathic tendencies. Our
  findings question whether lying is normative and common among most people, and instead
  suggest that most people are honest most of the time and that a small minority lies
  frequently. Â© 2013 International Communication Association.
