abstract: Precise, compared with round, asking prices lead to counteroffers and final
  agreements that are closer to the asking price. Consequently, popular advice for
  sellers is to set precise asking prices. We propose that the advice is useful, but
  only in a buyer's market, in which buyers counter below the asking price. In a seller's
  market, in which buyers counter above the asking price, sellers who wish to receive
  high counteroffers and sell for high prices should set round asking prices. A preregistered
  study (n = 1,809) shows that, compared with round asking prices, precise prices
  lead to higher counteroffers in a buyer's market but to lower counteroffers in a
  seller's market. The effect is driven by buyers' use of a finer-grained pricing
  scale when countering precise asking prices. An analysis of transactions (n = 8,278)
  from Amsterdam's 2017 real estate market, in which 70% of the properties were sold
  above the asking price, corroborates the experimental findings. Results show that
  increasing the roundness of the asking price by one decimal, for instance, from
  precise to the thousands to precise to the tens of thousands, was associated with
  an increase of 0.6% in the selling price, equivalent to â‚¬2,099 on average.
