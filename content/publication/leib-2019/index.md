abstract: In ambiguous settings, people are tempted to make self-serving mistakes.
  Here, we assess whether people make more self-serving mistakes to minimize losses
  compared with maximize gains. Results reveal that participants are twice as likely
  to make self-serving mistakes to reduce losses compared to increase gains. We further
  trace participants' eye movements to gain insight into the process underlying self-serving
  mistakes in losses and gains. We find that tempting, self-serving information does
  not capture more attention in loss, compared to gain framing. Rather, in loss framing,
  people are more likely to report the tempting, self-serving information they observed.
  The results imply that rather than diverting attention away from tempting information,
  reducing people's motivation to make self-serving mistakes, and framing goals as
  gains rather than losses are promising ways to decrease the occurrence of self-serving
  mistakes. In turn, this fosters environments with more accuracy and fewer motivated
  mistakes.
