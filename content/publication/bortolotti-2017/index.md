abstract: 'The steady increase in inequality over the past decades has revived a lively
  debate about what can be considered a fair distribution of income. Public support
  for the extent of redistribution typically depends on the perceived causes of income
  inequality, such as differences in effort, luck, or opportunities. We study how
  fairness views and the extent of redistribution are affected by a hitherto overlooked,
  but relevant factor: immoral self-serving behavior that can lead to increased inequality.
  We focus on situations in which the rich have potentially acquired their fortunes
  by means of cheating. In an experiment, we let third parties redistribute resources
  between two stakeholders who could earn money either by choosing a safe amount or
  by engaging in a risky, but potentially more profitable, investment. In one treatment,
  the outcome of the risky investment is determined by a random move, while in another
  treatment stakeholders can cheat to obtain the more profitable outcome. Although
  third parties cannot verify cheating, we find that the mere suspicion of cheating
  changes fairness views of third parties considerably and leads to a strong polarization.
  When cheating opportunities are present, the share of subjects redistributing money
  from rich to poor stakeholders triples and becomes as large as the fraction of libertarians
  - i.e., participants who never redistribute. Without cheating opportunities, libertarian
  fairness views dominate, while egalitarian views are much less prevalent. These
  results indicate that fairness views and attitudes towards redistribution change
  significantly when people believe that income inequality is the result of cheating
  by the rich.'
