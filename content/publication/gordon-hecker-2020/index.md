abstract: When allocating resources, people often have to resolve a conflict between
  equity and efficiency concerns. That is, sometimes for everyone to receive the same
  amount of resources, some resources must be used suboptimally. However, it is unclear
  whether and how people account for the impact their allocation decisions would have
  on the recipients' outcome. In three experiments, we examine how the amount of resources
  allocated to the recipients influences allocators' decisions and use mouse tracking
  techniques to assess their conflict during the decision process. The results reveal
  that when an equitable allocation of resources led to neither recipients receiving
  anything nor imposed losses, people tended to prefer efficient allocations. Such
  allocations between recipients who may end up with no resources also evoke a greater
  conflict compared with allocations in which both recipients have some secured gains,
  suggesting that, in general, people want to be equitable but not when equity means
  that nobody gets anything. When maintaining equity can only be done by leaving recipients
  with no resources at all, equitable allocations evoke a greater conflict, and people
  are more likely to refrain from them.
