abstract: 'We test the theory that shame evolved as a defense against being devalued
  by others. By hypothesis, shame is a neurocomputational program tailored by selection
  to orchestrate cognition, motivation, physiology, and behavior in the service of:
  (i) deterring the individual from making choices where the prospective costs of
  devaluation exceed the benefits, (ii) preventing negative information about the
  self from reaching others, and (iii) minimizing the adverse effects of devaluation
  when it occurs. Because the unnecessary activation of a defense is costly, the shame
  system should estimate the magnitude of the devaluative threat and use those estimates
  to cost-effectively calibrate its activation: Traits or actions that elicit more
  negative evaluations from others should elicit more shame. As predicted, shame closely
  tracks the threat of devaluation in the United States (r = .69), India (r = .79),
  and Israel (r = .67). Moreover, shame in each country strongly tracks devaluation
  in the others, suggesting that shame and devaluation are informed by a common species-wide
  logic of social valuation. The shame–devaluation link is also specific: Sadness
  and anxiety—emotions that coactivate with shame—fail to track devaluation. To our
  knowledge, this constitutes the first empirical demonstration of a close, specific
  match between shame and devaluation within and across cultures.'
