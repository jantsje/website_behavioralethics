abstract: Studies on lying, especially on inhibiting honest responses and generating
  dishonest responses, suggest that honesty is the default behavior and dishonesty
  requires deliberate effort. Here, we argue that when lying serves self-interest,
  that is, when lying is tempting and lies are easy to craft, honesty may require
  deliberation. We review studies that support this view showing that in tempting
  situations decreasing the level of self-control increased dishonesty, while encouraging
  contemplation and reflection increased honesty.
