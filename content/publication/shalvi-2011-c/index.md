abstract: This research examines whether and why people manoeuvre their unethical
  behaviour so as to maximize material gains at a minimal psychological cost. Employing
  an anonymous die-under-cup paradigm, we asked people to report the outcome of a
  private die roll and gain money as a function of their reports. Supporting self-concept
  maintenance theory, results showed that people avoid both major lies (i.e. over-reporting
  the highest possible outcome) and minor lies (yielding little material gain), but
  did over-report intermediate outcomes when this implied a substantial increase compared
  to a walk-away value. Results suggest that lying is psychologically costly. We propose
  that organizations allowing freedom of choice while narrowing the available ways
  to unethically boost personal profit should see a decrease in unethical behaviour
  among their employees. Â© 2010 British Academy of Management.
