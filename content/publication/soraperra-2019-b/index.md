abstract: Corruption in the education sector is pervasive in many (developing) countries.
  We examine two interventions to fight corruption in education. The first is an increase
  of the fixed-wage of teachers. The second is the introduction of a piece-rate scheme
  that rewards teachers according to the number of students that they attract. We
  model these mechanisms and conduct a lab experiment in Colombia, a country riddled
  with corruption. After creating a culture of corruption, we introduce either intervention.
  The increase of the fixed-wage does not diminish bribery. The piece-rate scheme
  substantially reduces but does not eliminate bribery.
