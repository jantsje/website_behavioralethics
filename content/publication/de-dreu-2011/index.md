abstract: Human ethnocentrism - the tendency to view one's group as centrally important
  and superior to other groups - creates intergroup bias that fuels prejudice, xenophobia,
  and intergroup violence. Grounded in the idea that ethnocentrism also facilitates
  withingroup trust, cooperation, and coordination, we conjecture that ethnocentrism
  may be modulated by brain oxytocin, a peptide shown to promote cooperation among
  in-group members. In double-blind, placebo-controlled designs, males self-administered
  oxytocin or placebo and privately performed computer-guided tasks to gauge different
  manifestations of ethnocentric in-group favoritism as well as out-group derogation.
  Experiments 1 and 2 used the Implicit Association Test to assess in-group favoritism
  and out-group derogation. Experiment 3 used the infrahumanization task to assess
  the extent to which humans ascribe secondary, uniquely human emotions to their in-group
  and to an out-group. Experiments 4 and 5 confronted participants with the option
  to save the life of a larger collective by sacrificing one individual, nominated
  as in-group or as out-group. Results show that oxytocin creates intergroup bias
  because oxytocin motivates in-group favoritism and, to a lesser extent, out-group
  derogation. These findings call into question the view of oxytocin as an indiscriminate
  \"love drug\" or \"cuddle chemical\" and suggest that oxytocin has a role in the
  emergence of intergroup conflict and violence.
