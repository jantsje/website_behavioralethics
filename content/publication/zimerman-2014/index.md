abstract: Are people honest about the extent to which they engage in unethical behaviors?
  We report an experiment examining the relation between self-reported risky unethical
  tendencies and actual dishonest behavior. Participants' self-reported risk taking
  tendencies were assessed using the Domain-Specific Risk-Taking (DOSPERT) questionnaire,
  while actual self-serving dishonesty was assessed using a private coin tossing task.
  In this task, participants predicted the outcome of coin tosses, held the predictions
  in mind, and reported whether their predictions were correct. Thus, the task allowed
  participants to lie about whether their predictions were correct. We manipulated
  whether reporting higher correct scores increased (vs. not) participants monetary
  payoff. Results revealed a positive relation between self-reported unethical risky
  tendencies and actual dishonesty. The effect was limited to the condition in which
  dishonesty was self-serving. Our results suggest liars are aware of their dishonest
  tendencies and are potentially not ashamed of them. Â© 2013.
