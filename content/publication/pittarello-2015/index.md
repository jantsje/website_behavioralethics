abstract: To some extent, unethical behavior results from people's limited attention
  to ethical considerations, which results in an ethical blind spot. Here, we focus
  on the role of ambiguity in shaping people's ethical blind spots, which in turn
  lead to their ethical failures. We suggest that in ambiguous settings, individuals'
  attention shifts toward tempting information, which determines the magnitude of
  their lies. Employing a novel ambiguous-dice paradigm, we asked participants to
  report the outcome of the die roll appearing closest to the location of a previously
  presented fixation cross on a computer screen; this outcome would determine their
  pay. We varied the value of the die second closest to the fixation cross to be either
  higher (i.e., tempting) or lower (i.e., not tempting) than the die closest to the
  fixation cross. Results of two experiments revealed that in ambiguous settings,
  people's incorrect responses were self-serving. Tracking participants' eye movements
  demonstrated that people's ethical blind spots are shaped by increased attention
  toward tempting information.
