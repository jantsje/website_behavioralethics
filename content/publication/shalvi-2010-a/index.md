abstract: At a top psychology journal, Psychological Science (PS), submissions peak
  during the summer months. We tested whether this seasonal submission bias decreases
  the likelihood of a paper being accepted in that period. Month of submission data
  was obtained for all 575 publications in PS for the period 2003-2006. Whereas submissions
  to PS were higher in the summer, there was no evidence that most accepted publications
  were originally submitted in the summer. Thus, contributors submit to PS when the
  likelihood of acceptance is the lowest - creating their own entrance barrier. A
  similar seasonal pattern was not identified for Personality and Social Psychology
  Bulletin, another top psychology journal. Using the Web of Knowledge database, we
  further assessed whether overcoming the seasonal entrance barrier influences the
  number of citations a paper receives in subsequent years. We discuss the possibility
  that the different rejections policies in the two journals, employing desk rejections
  or not, may explain this discrepancy, and explore a range of alternative hypotheses.
