abstract: 'Corruption in the form of bribery continues to be a major societal challenge
  around the world. The current lab-in-the-field study tested whether dynamic descriptive
  norms messages on posters can help to reduce bribery. Before, during and after placing
  posters throughout a medium-sized South African town, incentivized measures of social
  norms and bribery were assessed in a mobile lab. A total of 311 participants stemming
  from the general population took part. In line with the pre-registered predictions,
  the results reveal that people: (1) perceive bribery to be less common; and (b)
  engage in bribery in a corruption game less frequently when the posters were displayed.
  The discussion outlines how social norms nudging campaigns can be leveraged to spur
  collective action against corruption.'
