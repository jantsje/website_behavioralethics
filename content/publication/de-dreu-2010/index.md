abstract: Humans regulate intergroup conflict through parochial altruism; they self-sacrifice
  to contribute to in-group welfare and to aggress against competing out-groups. Parochial
  altruism has distinct survival functions, and the brain may have evolved to sustain
  and promote in-group cohesion and effectiveness and to ward off threatening out-groups.
  Here, we have linked oxytocin, a neuropeptide produced in the hypothalamus, to the
  regulation of intergroup conflict. In three experiments using double-blind placebo-controlled
  designs, male participants self-administered oxytocin or placebo and made decisions
  with financial consequences to themselves, their in-group, and a competing out-group.
  Results showed that oxytocin drives a \"tend and defend\" response in that it promoted
  in-group trust and cooperation, and defensive, but not offensive, aggression toward
  competing out-groups.
