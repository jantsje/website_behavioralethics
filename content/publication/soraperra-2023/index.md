abstract: "We experimentally study the social transmission of “inconvenient” information\
  \ about the externalities generated by one's own decision. In the laboratory, we\
  \ pair uninformed decision makers with informed senders. Compared to a setting where\
  \ subjects can choose their information directly, we find that social interactions\
  \ increase selfish decisions. On the supply side, senders suppress almost 30 percent\
  \ of “inconvenient” information, driven by their own preferences for information\
  \ and their beliefs about the decision maker's preferences. On the demand side,\
  \ about one-third of decision makers avoids senders who transmit inconvenient information\
  \ (“shooting the messenger”), which leads to assortative matching between information-suppressing\
  \ senders and information-avoiding decision makers. Having more control over information\
  \ generates opposing effects on behavior: selfish decision makers remain ignorant\
  \ more often and donate less, while altruistic decision makers seek out informative\
  \ senders and give more. We discuss applications to information sharing in social\
  \ networks and to organizational design."
