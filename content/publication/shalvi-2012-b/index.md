abstract: Recent research suggests that refraining from cheating in tempting situations
  requires self-control, which indicates that serving self-interest is an automatic
  tendency. However, evidence also suggests that people cheat to the extent that they
  can justify their unethical behavior to themselves. To merge these different lines
  of research, we adopted a dual-system approach that distinguished between the intuitive
  and deliberative cognitive systems. We suggest that for people to restrict their
  dishonest behavior, they need to have enough time and no justifications for self-serving
  unethical behavior. We employed an anonymous die-under-cup task in which participants
  privately rolled a die and reported the outcome to determine their pay. We manipulated
  the time available for participants to report their outcome (short vs. ample). The
  results of two experiments support our prediction, revealing that the dark side
  of people's automatic self-serving tendency may be overcome when time to decide
  is ample and private justifications for dishonesty are not available. Â© The Author(s)
