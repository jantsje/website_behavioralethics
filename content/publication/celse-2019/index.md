abstract: In this paper we experimentally explore how lying changes when its consequences
  are not certain. We argue that, when consequences are not certain, lying is morally
  less costly because the action of lying does not mechanically result in the obtainment
  of the benefit and this produces a lower feeling of responsibility in case the benefit
  is obtained. Moreover, we argue that the smaller the impact of lying on the probability
  to obtain the benefit the lower is the feeling of responsibility. We test our predictions
  using a modified die-under-the-cup task where misreporting, rather than delivering
  a higher payoff, increases the likelihood to get a prize. Overall we have four treatments
  where the reported outcome affects the probability to get a prize to a different
  extent. Contrary to our prediction, we do not observe any treatment difference suggesting
  that lying is independent to the extent to which it increases the probability to
  get a benefit. This result suggests that the willingness to lie to secure a benefit
  and the willingness to lie to marginally increase the probability to obtain a benefit
  are very similar.
