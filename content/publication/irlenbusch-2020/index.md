abstract: We report two experimental studies testing how a cognitive feeling of similarity
  affects dishonesty in individual and collaborative tasks when cheating hurts others.
  By employing a novel die-in-the-box paradigm with a total of 1080 subjects, we find
  that a sense of similarity (vs. dissimilarity) tends to increase dishonesty in settings
  highlighting the relationship with a collaborator, but tends to decrease dishonesty
  in settings highlighting the relationship with others who suffer from cheating.
  Corroborating these results, a code of conduct highlighting similarity towards the
  firm's employees leads to higher levels of cheating than a code of conduct highlighting
  similarity towards other members of the society. The results provide insights into
  how to craft effective organizational codes of ethical conduct.
