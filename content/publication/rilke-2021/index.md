abstract: We contribute to the pressing question of how organizational design influences
  corporate wrongdoing by studying different decision structures — simultaneous vs.
  sequential — in experimental coordination games. Participants can report private
  information honestly, or lie to increase their own, as well as the group's, payoff.
  In simultaneous decision structures, all group members report at the same time,
  without information about the reports of others, whereas in sequential decision
  structures there is a first mover who decides first. We find that the presence of
  a first mover decreases dishonesty levels in repeated interactions (but not in one-shot
  settings). We argue that this effect is primarily driven by image concerns of decision
  leaders.
