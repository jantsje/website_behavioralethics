abstract: Theories of dishonest behavior implicitly assume language independence.
  Here, we investigated this assumption by comparing lying by people using a foreign
  language versus their native tongue. Participants rolled a die and were paid according
  to the outcome they reported. Because the outcome was private, they could lie to
  inflate their profit without risk of repercussions. Participants performed the task
  either in their native language or in a foreign language. With native speakers of
  Hebrew, Korean, Spanish, and English, we discovered that, on average, people inflate
  their earnings less when they use a foreign language. The outcome is explained by
  a dual system account that suggests that self-serving dishonesty is an automatic
  tendency, which is supported by a fast and intuitive system. Because using a foreign
  language is less intuitive and automatic, it might engage more deliberation and
  reduce the temptation to lie. These findings challenge theories of ethical behavior
  to account for the role of the language in shaping ethical behavior.
