abstract: Cooperation is essential for completing tasks that individuals cannot accomplish
  alone. Whereas the benefits of cooperation are clear, little is known about its
  possible negative aspects. Introducing a novel sequential dyadic die-rolling paradigm,
  we show that collaborative settings provide fertile ground for the emergence of
  corruption. In the main experimental treatment the outcomes of the two players are
  perfectly aligned. Player A privately rolls a die, reports the result to player
  B, who then privately rolls and reports the result as well. Both players are paid
  the value of the reports if, and only if, they are identical (e.g., if both report
  6, each earns â‚¬6). Because rolls are truly private, players can inflate their profit
  by misreporting the actual outcomes. Indeed, the proportion of reported doubles
  was 489% higher than the expected proportion assuming honesty, 48% higher than when
  individuals rolled and reported alone, and 96% higher than when lies only benefited
  the other player. Breaking the alignment in payoffs between player A and player
  B reduced the extent of brazen lying. Despite player Bs central role in determining
  whether a double was reported, modifying the incentive structure of either player
  A or player B had nearly identical effects on the frequency of reported doubles.
  Our results highlight the role of collaboration-particularly on equal terms-in shaping
  corruption. These findings fit a functional perspective on morality.When facing
  opposing moral sentiments-to be honest vs. to join forces in collaboration-people
  often opt for engaging in corrupt collaboration.
