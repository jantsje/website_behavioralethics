abstract: Approach motivation, a focus on achieving positive outcomes, is related
  to relative left-hemispheric brain activation, which translates to a variety of
  right-oriented behavioral biases. In two studies, we found that approach-motivated
  individuals display a right-oriented bias, but only when they are forced to act
  quickly. In a task in which they had to divide lines into two equal parts, approach-motivated
  individuals bisected the line at a point farther to the right than avoidance-motivated
  individuals did, but only when they worked under high time pressure. In our analysis
  of all Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) World Cup penalty
  shoot-outs, we found that goalkeepers were two times more likely to dive to the
  right than to the left when their team was behind, a situation that we conjecture
  induces approach motivation. Because penalty takers shot toward the two sides of
  the goal equally often, the goalkeepers' right-oriented bias was dysfunctional,
  allowing more goals to be scored. Directional biases may facilitate group coordination
  but prove maladaptive in individual settings and interpersonal competition.
