abstract: Information advantage enables people to benefit themselves by deceiving
  their counterparts. Using a modified ultimatum bargaining game with an exit option,
  we find that people are more likely to avoid settings enabling them to privately
  deceive their counterparts than settings which do not enable deception. This tendency
  is explained by people's reduced desire to become responsible for the other's outcomes
  when deception is possible. Results of three experiments show that people avoid
  entering a setting that enables deception by appearing fair while being unfair (Exp.
  1-3). Experiment 2 showed that this tendency was reduced when interaction partners
  were displayed as competitive rather than cooperative. Experiment 3 showed a stronger
  tendency to avoid tempting situations that enable private deception than to approach
  situations in which one can privately benefit others. We conclude that when navigating
  through social space, people avoid situations enabling them to deceive others. Â©
