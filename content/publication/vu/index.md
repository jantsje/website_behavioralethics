abstract: People sometimes avoid information about the impact of their actions as
  an excuse to be selfish. Such “willful ignorance” reduces altruistic behavior and
  has detrimental effects in many consumer and organizational contexts. We report
  the first meta-analysis on willful ignorance, testing the robustness of its impact
  on altruistic behavior and examining its underlying motives. We analyze 33,603 decisions
  made by 6,531 participants in 56 different treatment effects, all employing variations
  of an experimental paradigm assessing willful ignorance. Meta-analytic results reveal
  that 40% of participants avoid easily obtainable information about the consequences
  of their actions on others, leading to a 15.6-percentage-point decrease in altruistic
  behavior compared to when information is provided. We discuss the motives behind
  willful ignorance and provide evidence consistent with excuse-seeking behaviors
  to maintain a positive self-image. We investigated the moderators of willful ignorance
  and address the theoretical, methodological, and practical implications of our findings
  on who engages in willful ignorance, as well as when and why.
