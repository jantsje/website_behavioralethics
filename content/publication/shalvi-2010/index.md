abstract: In negotiation, opening offers affect negotiated agreements. Across various
  negotiation settings, negotiators' outcomes are monotonically related to initial
  offer values (Chertk-Abstract Applying a multi-issue integrative negotiation scenario,
  we explored the relationship between negotiators' internal external (I-E) locus
  of control orientations, initial offers, and final negotiation outcomes. Focusing
  on the noninitiating party, we found that the degree to which initial offer recipients
  were internally versus externally oriented moderated the extent to which their final
  outcome was influenced by the initial offer they received. In comparison to externally
  oriented initial offer recipients, internally oriented recipients were less influenced
  by the proposed initial offer and managed to obtain more self favorable negotiation
  outcomes. This outcome advantage was due to the fact, that independent of the I-E
  orientation of the other negotiating party, internally oriented recipients reached
  agreements with higher total joint pie than externally oriented recipients and also
  managed to maintain a fair share of the pie.
