abstract: There is individual variation in the extent to which individuals believe
  it is acceptable to violate legal rules. However, we lack a specific measure that
  assesses this key internal element of legal decision-making and offending. This
  article describes the development, validation, and testing of the Rule Orientation
  scale. At its core, the construct captures the extent to which one thinks about
  rules in a rigid, rule-oriented manner or in a manner that recognizes exceptions.
  In the first study, we develop the Rule Orientation scale, demonstrate its convergent
  and divergent validity with key legal and moral reasoning scales, and find that
  Rule Orientation relates to hypothetical offending behavior across a variety of
  low-level crimes. In the second study, we examine whether Rule Orientation predicts
  the propensity to engage in digital piracy both with and without the explicit threat
  of punishment. The results indicate that Rule Orientation plays a crucial role in
  predicting offending behavior and, importantly, does so across enforcement contexts.
  The findings suggest that an individual with low Rule Orientation may be able to
  justify offending regardless of whether a system explicitly declares an enforcement
  campaign, regardless of how the individual perceives the severity of the threatened
  sanction, and regardless of whether the individual believes social norms support
  law violation. In understanding ethical decision-making, criminal decision-making,
  and other strands of legal decision-making, identifying such individual variation
  is crucial.
