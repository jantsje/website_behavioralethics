abstract: 'This study investigated neural responses to evaluations of lies made by
  others. Participants learned about other individuals who were instructed to privately
  roll a die twice and report the outcome of the first roll to determine their pay
  (with higher rolls leading to higher pay). Participants evaluated three types of
  outcomes: honest reports, justifiable lies (reporting the second outcome instead
  of the first), or unjustifiable lies (reporting a different outcome than both die
  rolls). Evaluating lies relative to honest reports was associated with increased
  activation in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), insula and lateral prefrontal
  cortex. Moreover, justifiable lies were associated with even stronger activity in
  the dorsal ACC and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex compared to unjustifiable lies.
  These activities were more pronounced for justifiable lies where the deviance from
  the real outcome was larger. Together, these findings have implications for understanding
  how humans judge misconduct behavior of others.'
