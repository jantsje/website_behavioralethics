abstract: Humans are social animals, but not everyone will be mindful of others to
  the same extent. Individual differences have been found, but would social mindfulness
  also be shaped by one's location in the world? Expecting cross-national differences
  to exist, we examined if and how social mindfulness differs across countries. At
  little to no material cost, social mindfulness typically entails small acts of attention
  or kindness. Even though fairly common, such low-cost cooperation has received little
  empirical attention. Measuring social mindfulness across 31 samples from industrialized
  countries and regions (n = 8,354), we found considerable variation. Among selected
  country-level variables, greater social mindfulness was most strongly associated
  with countries' better general performance on environmental protection. Together,
  our findings contribute to the literature on prosociality by targeting the kind
  of everyday cooperation that is more focused on communicating benevolence than on
  providing material benefits.
