abstract: Confessions are people's way of coming clean, sharing unethical acts with
  others. Although confessions are traditionally viewed as categorical-one either
  comes clean or not-people often confess to only part of their transgression. Such
  partial confessions may seem attractive, because they offer an opportunity to relieve
  one's guilt without having to own up to the full consequences of the transgression.
  In this article, we explored the occurrence, antecedents, consequences, and everyday
  prevalence of partial confessions. Using a novel experimental design, we found a
  high frequency of partial confessions, especially among people cheating to the full
  extent possible. People found partial confessions attractive because they (correctly)
  expected partial confessions to be more believable than not confessing. People failed,
  however, to anticipate the emotional costs associated with partially confessing.
  In fact, partial confessions made people feel worse than not confessing or fully
  confessing, a finding corroborated in a laboratory setting as well as in a study
  assessing people's everyday confessions. It seems that although partial confessions
  seem attractive, they come at an emotional cost. © 2014 American Psychological Association.
