abstract: Recipients of advice expect it to be both highly informed and honest. Suspecting
  either one of these attributes reduces the use of the advice. Does the degree of
  advice use depend on the reason for suspecting its accuracy? Five experiments tested
  the effect of the type of suspicion on advice taking. We find that recipients of
  advice discount it more severely when they suspect intentional bias than when they
  suspect unintentional error, for example, due to the advisor's insufficient knowledge.
  The effect persisted when we controlled for, and disclosed, the actual accuracy
  of the advice; it persisted when participants' own evaluations of the quality of
  the advice, as well as their desire to receive it, were equally high under both
  types of suspicion. Finally, we find the effect of suspicion on advice use stems
  from the different attributions of uncertainty associated with each type of suspicion.
  The results suggest people place an implicit premium on advisors' honesty, and demonstrate
  the importance of establishing reputation for advisors' success.
