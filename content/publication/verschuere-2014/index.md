abstract: Does the truth come naturally? And by implication, does this mean that a
  lie may not come as naturally as the truth? Truth-Default Theory and the Information
  Manipulation Theory 2 diverge in their opinion on whether people's natural response
  is to lie or tell the truth. In line with Truth-Default Theory, cognitive psychology
  research supports the notion that the truth is the default in human communication.
  Information Manipulation Theory 2 holds that lying may come as naturally as, or
  even more naturally than, truth telling, and recent social psychology research supports
  this possibility. We suggest that motivation may explain the divergence between
  the two theories and the two lines of research. We raise the hypothesis that truth
  telling may be the natural response absent clear motivations to lie (hence, most
  human communication) and that lying may prevail as the automatic reaction when it
  brings about important self-profit. We hope that this hypothesis will stimulate
  new research that will allow for bridging the theoretical and empirical findings
  that seem discrepant at first and show when the truth (vs. the lie) comes naturally.
