abstract: Hyper-realistic manipulations of audio-visual content, i.e., deepfakes,
  present new challenges for establishing the veracity of online content. Research
  on the human impact of deepfakes remains sparse. In a pre-registered behavioral
  experiment (N = 210), we show that (1) people cannot reliably detect deepfakes and
  (2) neither raising awareness nor introducing financial incentives improves their
  detection accuracy. Zeroing in on the underlying cognitive processes, we find that
  (3) people are biased toward mistaking deepfakes as authentic videos (rather than
  vice versa) and (4) they overestimate their own detection abilities. Together, these
  results suggest that people adopt a “seeing-is-believing” heuristic for deepfake
  detection while being overconfident in their (low) detection abilities. The combination
  renders people particularly susceptible to be influenced by deepfake content.
