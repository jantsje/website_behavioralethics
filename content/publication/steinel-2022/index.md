abstract: "We examine dishonest behavior in the face of potential uncertain gains\
  \ and losses in three pre-studies (N = 150, N = 225, N = 188) and a main study (N\
  \ = 240). Ample research has shown that people cheat when presented with the opportunity.\
  \ We use a die-under-cup paradigm, in which participants could dishonestly report\
  \ a private die roll and thereby increase the odds to obtain a desired outcome.\
  \ Results showed that the framing of the uncertain situation mattered: Participants\
  \ who lied to decrease the likelihood to experience a loss used major lies (i.e.,\
  \ reporting a ‘6'), while those who lied to increase the chance to achieve an equivalent\
  \ gain used more modest lies."
