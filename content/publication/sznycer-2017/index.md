abstract: 'Why do people support economic redistribution? Hypotheses include inequity
  aversion, a moral sense that inequality is intrinsically unfair, and cultural explanations
  such as exposure to and assimilation of culturally transmitted ideologies. However,
  humans have been interacting with worse-off and better-off individuals over evolutionary
  time, and our motivational systems may have been naturally selected to navigate
  the opportunities and challenges posed by such recurrent interactions. We hypothesize
  that modern redistribution is perceived as an ancestral scene involving three notional
  players: the needy other, the better-off other, and the actor herself. We explore
  how three motivational systems-compassion, self-interest, and envy-guide responses
  to the needy other and the better-off other, and how they pattern responses to redistribution.
  Data from the United States, the United Kingdom, India, and Israel support this
  model. Endorsement of redistribution is independently predicted by dispositional
  compassion, dispositional envy, and the expectation of personal gain from redistribution.
  By contrast, a taste for fairness, in the sense of (i) universality in the application
  of laws and standards, or (ii) low variance in group-level payoffs, fails to predict
  attitudes about redistribution.'
