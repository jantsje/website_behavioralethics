abstract: 'When allocating resources, equity and efficiency may conflict. When resources
  are scarce and cannot be distributed equally, one may choose to destroy resources
  and reduce societal welfare to maintain equity among its members. We examined whether
  people are averse to inequitable outcomes per se or to being responsible for deciding
  how inequity should be implemented. Three scenario-based experiments and one incentivized
  experiment revealed that participants are inequity responsibility averse: when asked
  to decide which of the 2 equally deserving individuals should receive a reward,
  they rather discarded the reward than choosing who will get it. This tendency diminished
  significantly when participants had the possibility to use a random device to allocate
  the reward. The finding suggests that it is more difficult to be responsible for
  the way inequity is implemented than to create inequity per se.'
