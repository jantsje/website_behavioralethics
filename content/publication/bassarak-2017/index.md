abstract: When people can profit financially by lying, they do so to the extent to
  which they can justify their lies. One type of justification is the observation
  and production of desirable counterfactual information. Here, we disentangle observing
  and producing of desired counterfactuals and test whether the mere observation is
  sufficient or whether one actually needs to produce the information in order to
  justify lying. By employing a modified version of the Die-Under-Cup task, we ask
  participants to privately roll a die three times and to report the outcome of the
  first die roll (with higher values corresponding to higher payoffs). In all three
  conditions, participants produce (roll the die) and observe the first die roll,
  which is relevant for pay. We manipulate whether participants produce and observe
  versus only observe the second and third die roll outcomes, which are both irrelevant
  for pay. Results reveal that people lie to the same extent—when producing and observing
  the counterfactuals, and when merely observing them. It seems that merely observing
  counterfactual information is sufficient to allow people to use this information
  to justify their lies. We further test whether creativity and moral disengagement
  are associated with dishonesty and replicate the finding showing that unethical
  behavior increases with creativity. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
