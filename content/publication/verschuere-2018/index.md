abstract: Lying typically requires greater mental effort than telling the truth. Imposing
  cognitive load may improve lie detection by limiting the cognitive resources needed
  to lie effectively, thereby increasing the difference in speed between truths and
  lies. We test this hypothesis meta-analytically. Across 21 studies using response-time
  (RT) paradigms (11 unpublished; total N = 792), we consistently found that truth-telling
  was faster than lying, but found no evidence that imposing cognitive load increased
  that difference (Control, d = 1.45; Load, d = 1.28). Instead, load significantly
  decreased the lie–truth RT difference by increasing the RT of truths, g = −.18,
  p =.027. Our findings therefore suggest that imposing cognitive load does not necessarily
  improve RT-based lie detection, and may actually worsen it by taxing the mental
  system and thus impeding people's ability to easily—and thus quickly—tell the truth.
