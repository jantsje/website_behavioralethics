abstract: Achieving successful and long-lasting behavior change via nudging comes
  with challenges. This is particularly true when choice architects attempt to change
  behavior that is collectively harmful but individually beneficial, such as dishonesty.
  Here, we introduce the concept of “meta-nudging” and illustrate its potential benefits
  in the context of promoting honesty. The meta-nudging approach implies that instead
  of nudging end-users directly, one would nudge them indirectly via “social influencers.”
  That is, one can arguably achieve better success by changing the behavior of those
  who have the ability to enforce other's behavior and norm adherence. We argue that
  this represents a promising new behavior change approach that helps overcome some
  of the challenges that the classical nudging approach has faced. We use the case
  of nudging honesty to develop the theoretical foundation of meta-nudging and discuss
  avenues for future work.
