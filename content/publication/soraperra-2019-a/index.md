abstract: Does the potential victim of dishonest behavior—a family or a bank, a pensioner
  or an insurance firm—affect the propensity to engage in such behavior? We investigate
  the effect of victim type—an individual person or an impersonal institution—on dishonest
  behavior and test whether it interacts with potential perpetrators' social value
  orientation (prosocial or proself). In a between-subjects design, we allowed experimental
  participants (N = 368) to misreport private information in order to increase (decrease)
  their profit (loss) at the expense of either another participant or the experimenter's
  budget. Both prosocials and proselfs engaged in dishonesty, but proselfs did so
  much more. Furthermore, prosocials reduced their dishonesty when the victim was
  another person, rather than an institution, but proselfs did not. A direct implication
  is that the dishonesty of prosocials may be curbed by increasing the salience of
  the adverse effect their dishonesty has on other individual people but that such
  interventions will not be effective for proselfs. In contrast with recent results,
  we did not find a general effect of increased dishonesty under a loss (vs. gain)
  frame.
