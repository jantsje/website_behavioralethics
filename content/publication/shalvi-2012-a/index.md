abstract: People not only seek to avoid losses or secure gains; they also attempt
  to create opportunities for obtaining positive outcomes. When distributing money
  between gambles with equal probabilities, people often invest in turning negative
  gambles into positive ones, even at a cost of reduced expected value. Results of
  an experiment revealed that (1) the preference to turn a negative outcome into a
  positive outcome exists when people's ability to do so depends on their performance
  levels (rather than merely on their choice), (2) this preference is amplified when
  the likelihood to turn negative into positive is high rather than low, and (3) this
  preference is attenuated when people can lie about their performance levels, allowing
  them to turn negative into positive not by performing better but rather by lying
  about how well they performed.
