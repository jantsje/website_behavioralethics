abstract: The sharing economy is estimated to add hundreds of billions of dollars
  to the global economy and is rapidly growing. However, trust-based commercial sharing—the
  participation in for-profit peer-to-peer sharing-economy activity—has negative as
  well as positive consequences for both the interacting parties and uninvolved third
  parties. To share responsibly, one needs to be aware of the various consequences
  of sharing. We provide a comprehensive, preregistered, systematic literature review
  of the consequences of trust-based commercial sharing, identifying 93 empirical
  papers spanning regions, sectors, and scientific disciplines. Via in-depth coding
  of the empirical work, we provide an authoritative overview of the economic, social,
  and psychological consequences of trust-based commercial sharing for involved parties,
  including service providers, users, and third parties. Based on the aggregate insights,
  we identify the common denominators for the positive and negative consequences.
  Whereas a well-functioning infrastructure of payment, insurance, and communication
  enables the positive consequences, ambiguity about rules, roles, and regulations
  causes non-negligible negative consequences. To overcome these negative consequences
  and promote more responsible forms of sharing, we propose the transparency-based
  sharing framework. Based on the framework, we outline an agenda for future research
  and discuss emerging managerial implications that arise when trying to increase
  transparency without jeopardizing the potential of trust-based commercial sharing.
