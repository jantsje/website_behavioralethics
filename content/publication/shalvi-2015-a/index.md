abstract: Unethical behavior by “ordinary” people poses significant societal and personal
  challenges. We present a novel framework centered on the role of self-serving justification
  to build upon and advance the rapidly expanding research on intentional unethical
  behavior of people who value their morality highly. We propose that self-serving
  justifications emerging before and after people engage in intentional ethical violations
  mitigate the threat to the moral self, enabling them to do wrong while feeling moral.
  Pre-violation justifications lessen the anticipated threat to the moral self by
  redefining questionable behaviors as excusable. Post-violation justifications alleviate
  the experienced threat to the moral self through compensations that balance or lessen
  violations. We highlight the psychological mechanisms that prompt people to do wrong
  and feel moral, and suggest future research directions regarding the temporal dimension
  of self-serving justifications of ethical misconduct.
