abstract: People experience fair and unfair treatment daily, and at times may react
  by breaking ethical rules and lying. Here, we assess the extent to which individuals
  engage in dishonest behavior aimed at helping or harming others after they experience
  (un)fair treatment. Across three financially incentivized experiments, recipients
  in a dictator game received a fair or unfair amount and then could, by means of
  dishonesty, inflate or deflate their counterparts' pay. Results show that dishonest
  helping is a common and robust behavior. Individuals lie to help others after fair,
  unfair, and no prior treatment. Dishonest harming, however, is less prevalent. Only
  after unfair treatment, some, but not all, individuals engage in dishonest harming.
  Dishonest harming was associated with high levels of anger and disappointment, and
  low levels of gratitude. Interestingly, the source of (un)fairness, whether it is
  intentional or not, did not attenuate peoples' behavior, suggesting that dishonest
  reactions to (un)fairness were driven by the mere (un)fair treatment, and not by
  a motivation to reciprocate an (un)fair counterpart.
