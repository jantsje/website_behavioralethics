abstract: People lie more when they work as a group rather than alone. However, do
  people suspect and morally evaluate groups and individuals differently when they
  are suspiciously successful? In four experiments, we examine whether (a) suspiciously
  successful individuals and groups are judged and punished differently and (b) individual
  group members are judged differently from the group as one unit. Results suggest
  that people suspect successful groups and individuals to the same extent. However,
  group members are less likely to be suspected, judged negatively, punished, and
  reported on, when they are judged as separate individuals compared with as a group.
  The findings demonstrate a bias in judgment of group members, stemming from the
  method of evaluationâ€”holistic or separate. We suggest that in order to minimize
  bias when judging misconduct by a group, the moral evaluation and punishment of
  all group members should be considered simultaneously.
