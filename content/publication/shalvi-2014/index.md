abstract: To protect and promote the well-being of others, humans may bend the truth
  and behave unethically. Here we link such tendencies to oxytocin, a neuropeptide
  known to promote affiliation and cooperation with others. Using a simple coin-toss
  prediction task in which participants could dishonestly report their performance
  levels to benefit their group's outcome, we tested the prediction that oxytocin
  increases group-serving dishonesty. A double-blind, placebo- controlled experiment
  allowing individuals to lie privately and anonymously to benefit themselves and
  fellow group members showed that healthy males (n = 60) receiving intranasal oxytocin,
  rather than placebo, lied more to benefit their group, and did so faster, yet did
  not necessarily do so because they expected reciprocal dishonesty from fellow group
  members. Treatment effects emerged when lying had financial consequences and money
  could be gained; when losses were at stake, individuals in placebo and oxytocin
  conditions lied to similar degrees. In a control condition (n = 60) in which dishonesty
  only benefited participants themselves, but not fellow group members, oxytocin did
  not influence lying. Together, these findings fit a functional perspective on morality
  revealing dishonesty to be plastic and rooted in evolved neurobiological circuitries,
  and align with work showing that oxytocin shifts the decision-maker's focus from
  self to group interests. These findings highlight the role of bonding and cooperation
  in shaping dishonesty, providing insight into when and why collaboration turns into
  corruption.
