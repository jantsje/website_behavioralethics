abstract: "Promotion deals and price reductions are common strategies retailers use\
  \ to attract consumers. We investigate which of two common types of deals better\
  \ captures consumers' attention. By tracing eye movements, we examine participants'\
  \ attention allocation when deciding between “buy-one-get-one free” (BOGO) deals\
  \ versus deals that offer an equivalent price reduction. Results show that people\
  \ prefer BOGO deals, and they tend to choose them over price reductions even when\
  \ the deals are equal in terms of net value. The preference is amplified when the\
  \ discount is relatively high: In these cases, BOGO deals attract more attention\
  \ than percentage deals. Overall, our findings can help retailers develop promotional\
  \ strategies to capture potential consumers' attention in online commerce. At the\
  \ same time, our results warn consumers to better evaluate their options and not\
  \ be lured by the first BOGO deal that captures their attention, as it might not\
  \ be the best deal available."
