abstract: Several studies show that social image concerns stimulate prosocial behavior.
  We study a setting in which there is uncertainty about which action is prosocial.
  Then, the quest for a better social image can potentially conflict with genuinely
  prosocial behavior. This conflict can induce “bad” behavior, where people lower
  both their own and others' material payoffs to preserve a good image. This setting
  is relevant for various types of credence goods. For example, recommending an inexpensive
  treatment reduces the expert's profits and may not satisfy the true needs of the
  client, but is generally good for the expert's image (as it signals the lack of
  greed). We test experimentally if people start to act bad in order to look good.
  We find that people care about their social image, but social image concerns alone
  do not induce them to act bad. That is, without future interactions, social image
  concerns do not lead to bad behavior. However, with future interactions, where building
  up a good image has instrumental value (reputational concerns), we do find evidence
  of bad behavior in the short run to secure higher earnings in the long run.
