abstract: Religious rituals are found all over the world. Some cultures engage in
  extreme religious rituals in which individuals take on forms of bodily harm to demonstrate
  their devotion. Such rituals entail excessive costs in terms of physical pain and
  effort, but the equivalent societal benefits remain unclear. The field experiment
  reported here examined the interplay between extreme rituals and moral behavior.
  Using a die-roll task to measure honest behavior, we tested whether engaging or
  observing others engaging in extreme ritual activities affects subsequent moral
  behavior. Strikingly, the results showed that extreme rituals promote moral behavior
  among ritual observers, but not among ritual performers. The discussion centres
  on the moral effects of rituals within the broader social context in which they
  occur. Extreme religious rituals appear to have a moral cleansing effect on the
  numerous individuals observing the rituals, which may imply that these rituals evolved
  to advance and maintain moral societies.
