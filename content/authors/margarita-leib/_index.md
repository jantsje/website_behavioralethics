I am interested in ethical decision making. In particularly, I study the cognitive process and (social) motivation that shapes people’s decision to be honest or to lie for financial profit. In my current work I focus on collaborative dishonesty – situations in which in order to collaborate with partners, people need to violate ethical rules and lie.
