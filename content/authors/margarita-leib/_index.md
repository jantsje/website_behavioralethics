I am interested in decision making and behavioral ethics. I study the dark side of pro sociality, specifically how people's pro social tendencies, such as reciprocity and cooperation, leads to breaking ethical rules and corruption. Additionally, I am interested in the underlying mechanisms (e.g., attention allocation) that enables people to create justifications for their lies.
