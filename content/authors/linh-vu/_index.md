I am a PhD candidate at CREED, under the supervision of Prof. dr. Shaul Shalvi and Prof. Dr. Joël van der Weele. I am interested in behavioural ethics and decision making. Currently, I'm researching willful ignorance in the context of the sharing economy. 

Before becoming a PhD candidate, I completed a research Master's degree in Cognitive Neuropsychology at [Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam](https://vuweb.vu.nl/en/) and a Bachelor's degree in Psychology at [University of Southampton](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/), United Kingdom. For more information, see Linh’s [personal website](https://sites.google.com/view/linh-vu/home).
