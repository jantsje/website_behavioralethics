I am a PhD candidate at CREED, under the supervision of Prof. dr. Shaul Shalvi and Dr. JoÃ«l van der Weele. I am interested in behavioural ethics and decision making. Currently, I'm researching willful ignorance in the context of the sharing economy. 

Before becoming a PhD candidate, I completed a research Master's degree in Cognitive Neuropsychology at [Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam](https://vuweb.vu.nl/en/) and a Bachelor's degree in Psychology at [University of Southampton](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/), United Kingdom. 

### Interests
