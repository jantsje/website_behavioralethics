Ivan Soraperra is a research scientist at the Center for Human and Machines of the Max Planck Institute for Human Development. My research interests are in the field of experimental and behavioral economics with a focus on the interaction between humans and A.I.  I am currently working on mapping human preferences distilled through large language models such as GPT-3, on the demand for face to face communication when human interactions are mediated by algorithms; and on the role of AI in the construction of (willful) ignorance.
