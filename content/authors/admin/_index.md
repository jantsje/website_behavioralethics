Behavioral ethics is the empirical study of ethical questions. We study topics like fairness, equality, values and norms. That is, how people behave when their decisions and actions impact others. At the moment, our lab is focused on understanding the psychological factors influencing people's behavior when using sharing economy platforms. We are especially interested to figure out how responsible sharing can be encouraged and maintained.
