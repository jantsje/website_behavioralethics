Tom is a Post-Doctoral researcher at the School of business administration at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, interested in decision making, fairness and ethics. In my research he studies how people make decisions under conflicting interests, such as a desire to increase one's payoff and her desire to act morally, or the desire to maintain equity and the desire to maximize overall payoffs.

Tom uses economic games, behavioral paradigms and process tracing techniques such as eye-tracking and mouse-tracking to uncover the thinking processes underlying such decisions.
