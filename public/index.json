However, trust-based commercial sharingâthe participation in for-profit peer-to-peer sharing-economy activityâhas negative as well as positive consequences for both the interacting parties and uninvolved third parties. To share responsibly, one needs to be aware of the various consequences of sharing. We provide a comprehensive, preregistered, systematic literature review of the consequences of trust-based commercial sharing, identifying 93 empirical papers spanning regions, sectors, and scientific disciplines. Via in-depth coding of the empirical work, we provide an authoritative overview of the economic, social, and psychological consequences of trust-based commercial sharing for involved parties, including service providers, users, and third parties. Based on the aggregate insights, we identify the common denominators for the positive and negative consequences. Whereas a well-functioning infrastructure of payment, insurance, and communication enables the positive consequences, ambiguity about rules, roles, and regulations causes non-negligible negative consequences. To overcome these negative consequences and promote more responsible forms of sharing, we propose the transparency-based sharing framework. Based on the framework, we outline an agenda for future research and discuss emerging managerial implications that arise when trying to increase transparency without jeopardizing the potential of trust-based commercial sharing.","tags":["collaborative economy","gig economy","on-demand economy","platform economy","trust"],"title":"The Consequences of Participating in the Sharing Economy: A Transparency-Based Sharing Framework","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" At the roots of corruption: a behavioral ethics approach  An EU Horizon 2020 Project\nFor many years, human cooperation has been praised as beneficial in organizational and personal settings. Indeed, cooperation allows people to develop trust, build meaningful relationships, achieve mutually beneficial outcomes, and strengthen bonding with one\u0026rsquo;s group members. However, while the benefits of cooperation are clear, very little is known about its possible negative aspects. Such negative aspects include the potential emergence of unethical conduct among cooperating partners, or as termed here â corrupt collaboration. Such joint unethical efforts, benefiting (directly or indirectly) one or more of the involved parties, occur in business, sports, and even academia. Corrupt collaboration emerges when one party bends ethical rules (here: lie) to set the stage for another party to further bend ethical rules and get the job done, that is, secure personal profit based on joint unethical acts. We propose that corrupt collaborations most commonly occur when all involved parties gain from the corrupt behavior. The current proposal is aimed at unfolding the roots and nature of corrupt collaborations; their existence, the psychological and biological processes underlying them, and the settings most likely to make corrupt collaboration emerge and spread. Accordingly, the information gathered in the current proposal has the potential to change the commonly held conceptions regarding the unidimensional â positive â nature of cooperation. It will help create a comprehensive understanding of cooperation and, specifically, when it should be encouraged or, alternatively, monitored.\n","date":1606435200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1606435200,"objectID":"a152ab4e62f05bb2b303782994e6cdaf","permalink":"https://www.jantsje.nl/project/roots_of_corruption/","publishdate":"2020-11-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/roots_of_corruption/","section":"project","summary":"At the roots of corruption","tags":null,"title":"Corruption","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Project title honesty  Project summary honesty\n","date":1606435200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1606435200,"objectID":"2314b3e99d67d5bb9c61789d3d066b1d","permalink":"https://www.jantsje.nl/project/honesty/","publishdate":"2020-11-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/honesty/","section":"project","summary":"Honesty","tags":null,"title":"Honesty","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Miscellaneous: all our other stuff!

Adding hundreds of billions of euro to the EU economy, it offers more choices to consumers and new opportunities to entrepreneurs. However, little is known about the bottom-up psychological factors driving the collaborative economy usersâ behaviour. For responsible sharing, trust is necessary but not sufficient. The EU-funded TRUSTPATH project will develop and test a psychological theory of how people use the collaborative economy. The hypothesis is that trust encouraged without transparency can lead users to neglect the negative side effects trade has on others. The findings will advance our understanding of the psychology of the collaborative economy and inform policymakers seeking to regulate it. The results will also be useful for companies seeking to promote responsible sharing among users.\n","date":1606435200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1606435200,"objectID":"f0a3e9a38b9d789e7496e6d329e4f9ba","permalink":"https://www.jantsje.nl/project/trustpath/","publishdate":"2020-11-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/trustpath/","section":"project","summary":"Responsible sharing - Paving the path for transparent trust","tags":null,"title":"Trustpath","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1582102800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1582102800,"objectID":"638917438f3a54a7f46fd291cc3fede5","permalink":"https://www.jantsje.nl/talk/heidelberg2020/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/heidelberg2020/","section":"talk","summary":"Presentation at the EEE workshop in Heidelberg","tags":[],"title":"Experimental Economics for the Environment (poster)","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Jantsje Mol","Eline C M van der Heijden","Jan J M Potters"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1578960000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1578960000,"objectID":"2dc430ca3f93779d9a09dcdff452b79b","permalink":"https://www.jantsje.nl/publication/mol-2020/","publishdate":"2020-01-31T09:11:10.439228Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mol-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"We conducted an experiment in a high-immersive virtual reality environment to study the effect of the presence of a virtual observer on cheating behavior. Par- ticipants were placed in a virtual room and played 30 rounds of a cheating game without a chance of their cheating being detected. We varied whether or not a vir- tual observer (an avatar) was present in the room, and, if so, whether the avatar was actively staring at the decision maker or passively seated in a corner watching his smartphone. Results display significantly less cheating with an active than with a passive avatar, but not less cheating than in a control condition without an avatar. This suggests that an active (virtual) observer can intensify reputational concerns, but that the presence of someone passive and uninterested may actually alleviate such concerns.\n[Open access PDF at publisher](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10683-020-09644-0) ","tags":["virtual reality experiment","cheating","watching eyes effect"],"title":"(Not) alone in the world: Cheating in the presence of a virtual observer","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nils C.

The current lab-in-the-field study tested whether dynamic descriptive norms messages on posters can help to reduce bribery. Before, during and after placing posters throughout a medium-sized South African town, incentivized measures of social norms and bribery were assessed in a mobile lab. A total of 311 participants stemming from the general population took part. In line with the pre-registered predictions, the results reveal that people: (1) perceive bribery to be less common; and (b) engage in bribery in a corruption game less frequently when the posters were displayed.

We investigate the effect of victim typeâan individual person or an impersonal institutionâon dishonest behavior and test whether it interacts with potential perpetrators' social value orientation (prosocial or proself). In a between-subjects design, we allowed experimental participants (N = 368) to misreport private information in order to increase (decrease) their profit (loss) at the expense of either another participant or the experimenter's budget. Both prosocials and proselfs engaged in dishonesty, but proselfs did so much more. Furthermore, prosocials reduced their dishonesty when the victim was another person, rather than an institution, but proselfs did not. A direct implication is that the dishonesty of prosocials may be curbed by increasing the salience of the adverse effect their dishonesty has on other individual people but that such interventions will not be effective for proselfs. In contrast with recent results, we did not find a general effect of increased dishonesty under a loss (vs. gain) frame.","tags":["dishonesty","framing","social value orientation","victim type"],"title":"Is the victim Max (Planck) or Moritz ?

We examine two interventions to fight corruption in education. The first is an increase of the fixed-wage of teachers. The second is the introduction of a piece-rate scheme that rewards teachers according to the number of students that they attract. We model these mechanisms and conduct a lab experiment in Colombia, a country riddled with corruption. After creating a culture of corruption, we introduce either intervention. The increase of the fixed-wage does not diminish bribery. The piece-rate scheme substantially reduces but does not eliminate bribery.","tags":["education","corruption","theory","experiment"],"title":"A Market for Integrity - An Experiment on Corruption in the Education Sector","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ivan Soraperra","Anton Suvorov","Jeroen Van de Ven","Marie Claire Villeval"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1612521665,"objectID":"0eff70f114b29e068898ee888366be27","permalink":"https://www.jantsje.nl/publication/soraperra-2019/","publishdate":"2021-02-05T10:41:05.445631Z","relpermalink":"/publication/soraperra-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"Several studies show that social image concerns stimulate prosocial behavior. We study a setting in which there is uncertainty about which action is prosocial. Then, the quest for a better social image can potentially conflict with genuinely prosocial behavior. This conflict can induce âbadâ behavior, where people lower both their own and others' material payoffs to preserve a good image. This setting is relevant for various types of credence goods. For example, recommending an inexpensive treatment reduces the expert's profits and may not satisfy the true needs of the client, but is generally good for the expert's image (as it signals the lack of greed). We test experimentally if people start to act bad in order to look good. We find that people care about their social image, but social image concerns alone do not induce them to act bad. That is, without future interactions, social image concerns do not lead to bad behavior. However, with future interactions, where building up a good image has instrumental value (reputational concerns), we do find evidence of bad behavior in the short run to secure higher earnings in the long run.","tags":["credence goods","experiment","prosocial behavior","reputation","social image"],"title":"Doing Bad to Look Good: Negative Consequences of Image Concerns on Prosocial Behavior","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shaul Shalvi","Ivan Soraperra","Joel J. van der Weele","Marie Claire Villeval"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1612521169,"objectID":"58f4aae848407bbe859fe2303f30e26e","permalink":"https://www.jantsje.nl/publication/shalvi-2019/","publishdate":"2021-02-05T10:37:50.680521Z","relpermalink":"/publication/shalvi-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"We investigate the role of advisers in the transmission of ethically relevant information, a critical aspect of executive decision making in organizations. In our laboratory experiment, advisers are informed about the negative externalities associated with the decision-makerâs choices and compete with other advisers. We find that advisers suppress about a quarter of âinconvenientâ information. Suppression is not strategic, but based on the advisersâ own preferences in the ethical dilemma. On the demand side, a substantial minority of decision makers avoid advisers who transmit inconvenient information (they âshoot the messengerâ). Overall, by facilitating assortative matching, a competitive market for advisers efficiently caters to the demand for both information and information avoidance. Decision-makers are less likely to implement their preferred option when they are randomly matched to advisers and there is no scope for assortative matching.","tags":["self-deception","information avoidance","unethical behavior","experiment"],"title":"Shooting the Messenger?

We argue that, when consequences are not certain, lying is morally less costly because the action of lying does not mechanically result in the obtainment of the benefit and this produces a lower feeling of responsibility in case the benefit is obtained. Moreover, we argue that the smaller the impact of lying on the probability to obtain the benefit the lower is the feeling of responsibility. We test our predictions using a modified die-under-the-cup task where misreporting, rather than delivering a higher payoff, increases the likelihood to get a prize. Overall we have four treatments where the reported outcome affects the probability to get a prize to a different extent. Contrary to our prediction, we do not observe any treatment difference suggesting that lying is independent to the extent to which it increases the probability to get a benefit. This result suggests that the willingness to lie to secure a benefit and the willingness to lie to marginally increase the probability to obtain a benefit are very similar.","tags":["dishonesty","lies","uncertainty"],"title":"Uncertain lies: How payoff uncertainty affects dishonesty","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ivan Soraperra","Ori Weisel","Ro'i Zultan","Sys Kochavi","Margarita Leib","Hadar Shalev","Shaul Shalvi"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1509494400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1612521169,"objectID":"4dac482d04ef0b8508b97fc6d6fb717c","permalink":"https://www.jantsje.nl/publication/soraperra-2017/","publishdate":"2021-02-05T10:37:50.364579Z","relpermalink":"/publication/soraperra-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"People are rather dishonest when working on collaborative tasks.

In the norm exposure treatment, participants receive the same information regarding their partner's action as in the collaborative treatment, but receive payoffs based only on their own reports.

Public support for the extent of redistribution typically depends on the perceived causes of income inequality, such as differences in effort, luck, or opportunities. We study how fairness views and the extent of redistribution are affected by a hitherto overlooked, but relevant factor: immoral self-serving behavior that can lead to increased inequality. We focus on situations in which the rich have potentially acquired their fortunes by means of cheating. In an experiment, we let third parties redistribute resources between two stakeholders who could earn money either by choosing a safe amount or by engaging in a risky, but potentially more profitable, investment. In one treatment, the outcome of the risky investment is determined by a random move, while in another treatment stakeholders can cheat to obtain the more profitable outcome. Although third parties cannot verify cheating, we find that the mere suspicion of cheating changes fairness views of third parties considerably and leads to a strong polarization. When cheating opportunities are present, the share of subjects redistributing money from rich to poor stakeholders triples and becomes as large as the fraction of libertarians - i.e., participants who never redistribute. Without cheating opportunities, libertarian fairness views dominate, while egalitarian views are much less prevalent. These results indicate that fairness views and attitudes towards redistribution change significantly when people believe that income inequality is the result of cheating by the rich.","tags":["fairness views","redistribution","unethical behavior","inequality","experiment"],"title":"Too Lucky to Be True: Fairness Views under the Shadow of Cheating","type":"publication"}]
