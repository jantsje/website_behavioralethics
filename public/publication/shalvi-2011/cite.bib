Hypothesis: reducing people's ability to observe desired counterfactuals reduces lying. Die-under-the-cup paradigm. 1. In the single roll condition, lying was reduced (distribution did not differ from uniform)
2. Asking pp after reading instructions what they would have done. 69.6% would have reported honestly.
3. Coding justified lies of other people's die rolls. peole viewed a lie more severely when it did not match the counterfactual support
4. extending experiment 3 by manipulating the nr of observed desired counterfactuals},
